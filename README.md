#Say It For Me
		There area a million tools for generating dummy text or images, so I made another one.
##Usage
###Ipsum
Perhaps you just want some very traditional Ipsum text

		http://localhost:3000/ipsum

Why not try some fresh pork instead?

		http://localhost:3000/bacon

###Cats
The internet loves cats... So lets see what we can do with them?

		http://localhost:3000/cats

Too much color scares me. Can I have black and white?

		http://localhost:3000/cats/bw/

I need a specific size!

		http://localhost:3000/cats/300/400

OK I want it small, but also black and white...

		http://localhost:3000/cats/300/400/bw
